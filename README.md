# FCC-Project-TicTacToe Game
Advanced level front end project as part of [FreeCodeCamp][fcc].

**Hosted on Github Pages**  
This app can be accessed through [https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-tic-tac-toe]("https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-tic-tac-toe" "Front end Tic Tac Toe Game project on github pages").  

**Challenges**  
*As usual, few additional challenges I set up for myself*
- [x] No jQuery or Bootstrap or any other library for that matter (how else one can learn?)
- [x] Accessibility through keyboard (X / O for player selection, 1 to 9 for gaming!)

**First taste of AI**
At about 11.30pm on 11th Nov 2016, this bot became self-aware (so to speak). I was just fixing few last glitches (half asleep), and this bot started beating me several games straight. It was a weird feeling, but felt good. I slept well that night.
